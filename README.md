# ACSProject
This was my OCR A Level Computer Science project. Assessed in Summer 2023, it scored 63/70 (just on an A*) but that's mostly down to documentation (not shown here).

It was intended to be a notetaking software with flashcards integrated, like a streamlinked Anki. 

It was my first time properly using TypeScript, which I really did enjoy due to how weakly-typed JavaScript (my main language up until this point) is.

We had a lot of fun in Computer Science but this project was not included in that. The editor is very faulty and I'm unhappy with how I implemented it, at some point I might do a dramatic overhaul, but this project has a bad aura.

If you're at the start of your A Level Computer Science project, please do the easiest project for the highest reward. If you can score all 70 marks making Flappy Bird Ultimate (or something similar), please just do that instead. Do not unnecessarily challenge yourself when it comes to this project, challenge yourself with your personal projects, but PLEASE do something safe for this. 

This project took so much time towards the end, and the documentation was 49,562 words long, most other peoples' in my class were around 15,000 words.
A large project will eat into the vital time from March until June which should be used solely to revise, so please do just do something simple. 
You need to focus on the exams more than anything else.

(Working version of the project found [here](https://alevelcomputerscienceproject.regimen.social/). The flashcard system is perfect~, the editor is not.)
